# Combo Box Challenge 
This project is a submission for the combo box challenge. The goal is to create a combo box using TypeScript, Vite, and React, following the provided mockup.

## Technologies Used

-   TypeScript
-   Vite
-   React

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    
    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/combo-box-challenge.git` 
    
2.  **Navigate to the project folder:**
    
    `cd combo-box-ui` 
    
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    
    `yarn install` 
    
4.  **Run the application:**
    
    `npm run dev` 
    
5.  **Open your browser and go to** `http://localhost:5173` **to view the combo box.**

## Implementation Considerations

-   The project uses Vite as the build tool for fast development and TypeScript for type-checking.
-   The combo box is implemented as a React component (`ComboBox.tsx`) combining a drop-down list and an input text field.
-   No external combo box libraries were used to meet the challenge requirements.
-   The structure is kept simple for clarity and easy understanding.

## Additional Items Implemented

-   **Accessibility:** Efforts have been made to ensure the combo box is accessible, with proper labeling and keyboard navigation.
-   **Unit Testing:** Basic unit tests have been included to verify the functionality of the combo box component.

## Future Improvements

-   Support for multiple input methods.
